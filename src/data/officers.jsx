I was born in North Carolina and have since lived in 5 different states all across the US. One of my biggest hobbies (other than running) is origami! I can make almost anything out of paper and it‚Äôs a ton of fun. My favorite part of the club is the close knit community that we build and seeing all the friendships that are made here. We have a ton of fun together and we definitely take the phrase ‚Äúwork hard, play hard‚Äù seriously. I can‚Äôt wait to meet all of you, and if you ever have any questions about anything please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out!"

        bio: "Hey there! My name is Wyatt and I am honored to be the President of the Club XCTF team this year! A little bit about myself is that I‚Äôm a junior double majoring in physics and math, and I‚Äôm a long distance runner. I race the 5k, 1500, and 8k, and I‚Äôve got all the quirks that distance runners have. I‚Äôm also a big fan of bad jokes. I love this club so much and I‚Äôve met so many great people here that have become lifelong friends. I can‚Äôt wait until club starts again so I can see my friends and meet new people. I‚Äôm really excited for this upcoming year and we have a lot of fun things planned. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out! I will happily answer any and all. I‚Äôm looking forward to meeting and training with all of you!"

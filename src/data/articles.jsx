            <p>Welcome y'all to your new favorite corner of the internet, my unhinged thoughts during the making of this website, or what I like to call 'Webdev Diaries.'</p>
            <p>It's 2:36AM and I've been doing this for about 12 hours now but I finally finished the main functionality and most of the polish for the page you're on now. Despite how long it took, working on this page actually gave me a lot of confidence for how the rest of this process will go.</p>
            <p>Believe it or not, I had originally planned for the site to go live around the beginning of the Fall but it kept getting bigger and bigger and with school and running on top of it, I had to push it back. Hopefully you're as impressed with the final result as I hope to be!</p>
            <p>Anyways, have you checked out ChatGPT yet? This part of the blog will probably be a bit outdated by the time you see this but it's incredible what it can do. I'm mostly impressed by how well it can write and understand code. I actually asked it for help one of the times I was stuck making this page and it showed me how to do exactly what I was trying to and even gave examples.</p>
            <p>I'll leave a link to it <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target={"_blank"} rel="noreferrer">here</a> so you can see for yourself and this is also my first time testing external links from articles so hopefully that worked.</p>
            <p>There's a lot of work to do tomorrow so I should probably get some sleep so thank you for tuning in to the first ever (weekly?) edition of Webdev Diaries by yours truly, Volkan, and if you're reading this in the future, which you will be, let me know at practice what you think!</p>

            <p>While filling big shoes left by former Alberta Golden Bears coach Terry Danyluk, Brock Davidiuk has also brought a wealth of volleyball knowledge to the university’s sideline.</p>
            <p>Davidiuk took over the head coaching reins of his former team in 2019, 13 years after graduating from the school. As a player with the Bears, he was named Championship MVP as he helped lead the team to a 2005 CIS National Championship title– a milestone he’ll be looking to re-create now that he’s behind the bench.</p>
            <p>After his time with the university, Davidiuk went to have an impressive playing career professionally overseas, and a international career with the Canadian National Team, eventually serving as the team’s captain. He helped lead the squad to a berth at the 2010 FIVB World Championship.</p>
            <p>He re-joined the Bears in 2012 as a part-time volunteer, working his way up to assistant coach, then associate coach, and now serves as the head coach. In 2016, he completed his Masters of Coaching degree.</p>
            <p>Volleyball Canada recently had a chance to talk with Davidiuk about his coaching career and some thoughts on coaching in the sport.</p>

        <p>
          As you all likely know by now, for the first time in club history, we
          have claimed the XC nationals title! In a nail-biting race, your men‚Äôs
          championship team edged out Cal Poly by a single point to win the race
          and bring home our first XC Nats trophy (and a giant Hershey‚Äôs bar)!
          The women‚Äôs championship team finished 5th after a very competitive
          race and cemented the fact that we are undoubtedly the most
          well-rounded team in the nation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In the last 3 years of national competition (track and XC, men and
          women), we‚Äôve come in 1st place 3 times, 2nd place 2 times, 3rd place
          5 times and 5th place 2 times. And 0 times below 5th place in that
          time span. No one else does it like we do, and the culture of
          consistency, well-roundedness, and depth we have is something to
          appreciate.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we wrap up the season, take pride in what we‚Äôve accomplished
          together and the legacy we‚Äôre building for the future. This title
          belongs to every one of you, and it‚Äôs a reflection of the hard work
          and heart you bring to this team.

          all the support they can get during their race! What better way to
          support your fellow teammates than to cheer them on with posters made
          with love? Poster making is optional but having fun is not, so we will
          also have a movie for everyone on the projector. Keep an eye out for a
          GroupMe poll to pick the movie! We will meet in Durham 261 at 6pm on
          Sunday, November 3.

          Somehow, we‚Äôve always had events on Thursdays, but we‚Äôre so back this
          week! After the costume contest and practice, head over to the Bubble
          to pump some iron with your fellow cross country and track &amp; field
          stars.

          You can purchase a singlet during practice from our apparel officer
          Molly. We only accept cash or check (made out to ‚ÄúTreasurer at
          Virginia Tech‚Äù). You only have to purchase a singlet once and you can
          reuse it every other year you compete with club.

        <p>3. Find the VT Club XCTF Photo album.&nbsp;</p>

          You will get an email from our wonderful race coordinator Ellie later
          this week with specific information for the UVA meet. To compete in
          NIRCA meets, you are required to wear a VT singlet. We have specially
          licensed singlets that we purchase every year and sell for $40 (we
          make no profit from this!)
        </p>
        <p>
          You can purchase a singlet during practice from our apparel officer
          Molly. We only accept cash or check (made out to ‚ÄúTreasurer at
          Virginia Tech‚Äù). You only have to purchase a singlet once and you can
          use it to race each semester. If you are only planning on racing in
          the Spring, you can wait till then to purchase one.&nbsp;

          The long-awaited Van Draft‚Ñ¢&nbsp;is finally here. This is an

          &nbsp;format. The draft will take place in
          <strong>Wallace 340 at 8:00pm on Tuesday, April 2</strong>. By random
          number generator, Tyler Houston &amp; Christian Crawley's van has been
          chosen to make the first overall pick. The remaining 10 driver pairs
          have also been assigned a slot from 2-11. The pairs will make two
          picks per round, and we will alternate order of picking per the rules
          of the snake draft.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the conclusion of the initial drafts, there will be time
          given to each van to consult among themselves and offer trades to
          other vans. After a maximum of 30 minutes of deliberation, we will
          deem all vans final and share the results on GroupMe. Do not fear if
          you are not a van driver, because as soon as you are drafted to a van,
          you are able to participate in discussion within your new van about
          future picks as well as potential trades.

        <p>
          It's kind of crazy that our first meet is in just a couple of weeks.
          I'll be fulfilling my presidential duty and racing the 100 right after
          I race the 5000. I have no idea what I can run in a 100. Oh, did I
          mention that I'll also be wearing khakis? I also don't know how to use
          blocks. That'll be a fun time.

        <p>
          Your fun fact this week is going to be about very long sports
          competitions. The longest-ever recorded soccer game lasted three hours
          and 23 minutes, way back in 1946. This game had to be spread across
          two days because it got too dark and floodlights apparently weren't a
          thing yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The longest baseball game lasted 26 innings in 1920. That's crazy. I
          hope you survive this week! You can do this. If you need to chat about
          anything or have any ideas for club, just let me know!

        <h3>
          And now for what you've all been waiting for...
          <br />
          The soccer social recap
        </h3>
        <p>
          It was a cold and rainy day in Blacksburg. Club members of all
          disciplines came together to determine the owner of the 2024 Club XCTF
          soccer title. The Sprints &amp; Field squad was looking to defend
          their title while the distance team came in with a chip on their
          shoulder after a humiliating loss last year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Distance came in rocking the classic Hokie orange and Sprints &amp;
          Field wore the VT Maroon. Captaining the two sides was Harris Naseh
          for distance and Joe Gora for sprint/field. Ben Darden put his
          loyalties aside and refereed what would be an intense game. The rules
          were simple, 11 v 11 playing 4 quarters of 10 minutes each.
        </p>
        <img src="https://imgur.com/eNYQZMN.jpg" />
        <p>
          From the beginning whistle Sprints &amp; Field were on the front foot
          with chance after chance barely allowing the ball onto their side of
          the field. The pressure was too high for Distance as Liam Haley broke
          through their defense and put his name on the scoring sheet. Sprint
          &amp; Field fans were buzzing, and it seemed like the Distance team
          was in for a long day.
        </p>
        <img src="https://imgur.com/Ytz8s5C.jpg" />
        <p>
          As the remaining minutes of the first quarter went by the Distance
          lads seemed to get going as they were mounting their attack. Just as
          the dying seconds of the first quarter were coming to an end Daniel
          Murray of Distance equalized to bring some life back into the team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amid a storm that saw hail and wind tear at the field nonstop, the
          2024 Club XCTF soccer title drama played out with a passion and
          intensity that will go down in Blacksburg's sports history books. Even
          if the skies above were turbulent, the competition between Distance
          and Track &amp; Field on the ground was nothing short of spectacular.
        </p>
        <img src="https://imgur.com/Jab4GGW.jpg" />
        <p>
          Sprints &amp; Field took the lead with a second goal that was
          decisively scored by Liam Haley, who once again scored with the
          elegance of an experienced striker. His skill on the field was
          evident, as he made the score 2-1 and electrified the Maroon
          supporters.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the Distance team refused to let their spirits be dampened by
          the weather or the scoreboard. Samuel Yakulis, in a moment that seemed
          to defy the gravity of his experience, scored his first-ever goal,
          equalizing for Distance and sending a clear message: they were not
          going down without a fight.
        </p>
        <p>
          The conditions on the field were brutal, but both teams soldiered on,
          their determination unwavering in the face of nature's fury. Sprints
          &amp; Field, in a move of strategic brilliance, brought on James
          Paylor as goalkeeper.
        </p>
        <img src="https://imgur.com/yVnyxpz.jpg" />
        <p>
          His introduction was a game-changer; Paylor, standing like a brick
          wall between the posts, thwarted attempt after attempt from the
          Distance attackers. Yet, the resilience of the Distance team shone
          brightly against the adversity, as Jadon Peterson broke through to
          score the third for Distance, putting them ahead for the first time in
          the match.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pendulum swung once more when Liam Haley, in a display of sheer
          will and skill, completed his hat trick, drawing Track &amp; Field
          level and pushing the game into the realm of legends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overtime loomed with the golden goal rule in play, a crucible moment
          where heroes are forged, and tales of glory are born. It was a
          do-or-die situation, with Distance eyeing their first title and
          Sprints &amp; Field aiming for a historic repeat.
        </p>
        <img src="https://imgur.com/rrmNHO9.jpg" />
        <p>
          The physical toll was evident as players from both sides laid
          everything on the line. Harris Naseh and Chatham Campbell, in acts of
          bravery, returned to the pitch despite painful setbacks, embodying the
          spirit of their teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          As fatigue began to gnaw at the players, and a stalemate persisted, an
          unexpected twist saw Andrew Bennett, a longtime critic of Daniel
          Murray, subbed on for Murray, only to be sidelined for lack of proper
          footwear and Murray made his return to the field.
        </p>
        <img src="https://imgur.com/NI3fqjy.jpg" />
        <p>
          Fate had its script, and Murray, returning to the pitch, would become
          the architect of Distance's triumph, scoring the golden goal that
          crowned them champions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The joy that the distance runners were experiencing was evident, in
          sharp contrast to the disappointment that the Sprints &amp; Field team
          was experiencing when their heroic efforts came up short. Ultimately,
          the chilly and wet Blacksburg day witnessed a feat of soccer that
          defied the elements and destiny, with Distance winning their first
          Club XCTF soccer championship in a match that will live in memory
          forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Final score: 4-3 Distance win.
          <br />
          MVP: James Paylor

          <strong>Officer Intrest Meeting</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Interested in running for an officer position next school year? Well,
          come join us in Wallace 340 at 2:45 pm on Sunday, December 3rd for an
          officer interest meeting. Each officer will have some slides prepared
          to discuss what they do, and we'll have a Q&amp;A session so you can
          ask any questions you have. Even if you're just thinking about running
          for a position, I highly recommend you stop by as you can learn a lot
          of information about what each officer does. Being an officer is a
          great way to be more involved in the club, as they are the reason why
          this club functions as well as it does. We have positions ranging from
          event captains to apparel officer or race coordinator.&nbsp;

          of wind and had a great time at their throw-off. Continue to support
          your teammates because we can only get so far on our own. And a

          not the case for now, but please be on the lookout. If you have any

        <h3>Where Can I See Photos Photos from Practice and Meets?</h3>
        <p>
          This is sort of fluid but for now, the photos from this semester can

          . In the past, we've had issues with there being too many photos in
          one album so by the end of the semester it would take a long time to
          scroll all the way down to the most recent photos.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          An idea I had is we could have separate albums for practice, socials,
          and each of the meets and have a page on the website that lists each
          album so you can go directly where you want and don't have to scroll
          through 7,000 photos to see the ones you want.

        <p>
          What's really funny is that these are supposed to be out on Mondays so
          I could tell you to come to the social. Instead, it's Wednesday and
          the social has already happened but the good news is I have some
          photos from the event. Also there's been a lot of changes to how the
          website works behind the scenes so <em>Webdev Diaries </em>is also
          making a comeback soon and I can't wait to tell you all about it!

          <strong>Wildcat ‚ÄúTwilight‚Äù Recap</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          You ever just drive 2 hours and warm up, get to the start line to race
          your first ever 3k steeple just so they can delay everything due to
          lightning? Well despite that, scrambling to move all of our wet stuff
          to hide in the vans, and periodic rain throughout the rest of the
          meet, we still went out with a bang. Five club records were broken as
          well as many PRs, and although there was no 5k under the moonlight,
          everyone had a great time.
        </p>
        <p>Records:</p>
        <li>Noah LeCain - 3k Steeple - 9:45.79</li>
        <li>
          K Crawford, E Donlon, R Ophof, J Williams - 4x100m Relay - 50.62s
        </li>
        <li>Jessica Williams - Triple Jump - 11.42m</li>
        <li>Jenny Patel - Hammer Throw - 21.93m</li>

          This one was bittersweet‚Ä¶ Probably the first time I‚Äôve cried at a
          track meet, and I wasn‚Äôt the only one. To our seniors: we will miss
          you. Whether you just joined this year or you‚Äôve been with us for 4
          years, through COVID, name changes, and two national championships,
          thank you for sticking with us through the highs and lows. You all
          have been so instrumental in getting the club to where it is.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          As friends, mentors, and role models, your impact can‚Äôt be overstated.
          When I first joined the club last year, it was the seniors who took me
          under their wing and showed me all the club had to offer. I wouldn‚Äôt
          be here writing this if not for those acts of kindness from people
          like Jessie, Jared, and Maddie. Many of you probably don‚Äôt even know
          who I‚Äôm talking about, but I promise that you‚Äôve felt the impact they
          and many others like them throughout the years have had on the club in
          some way.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at this year‚Äôs graduating class, I see the same welcoming
          energy that made this place home for me, and I know you all have done
          that for all the newcomers this year. We wish you the best wherever
          life takes you and want you to know that you all will be missed
          dearly, and you‚Äôll always have a home here‚Ä¶

          This is the last week of practice, so Friday is our last day. This has
          been such a crazy year, but thank you all for making it worth it. I am
          so excited to be your president next year and go on all the crazy
          adventures together. Whether you showed up to one practice or every
          single one, thank you for being a part of this team. You guys are my
          family, for as chaotic as it can be.

        <p>
          Wyatt&#39;s Fun Fact of the Week: Welcome to my last fun fact! Today
          (Editor‚Äôs note: yesterday), 33 years ago, the Hubble Space Telescope
          was launched into space. This revolutionized the field of astrophysics
          and has led to some of the most beautiful pictures being published.
          Someone also suggested that I include fun facts about myself, so
          I&#39;ll let you know that I first came to VT wanting to do
          astrophysics. I learned after my first year that astrophysics
          wasn&#39;t my thing (even though I was dead-set on it for three
          years), and instead, I switched to <i>experimental</i> condensed
          matter physics, focusing on sustainable nanotechnologies. It&#39;s
          okay to not know entirely what you want to do coming into college, and
          switching fields and exploring is totally normal. Just do whatever
          makes you happy and what you&#39;re passionate about. That is why I
          run.
        </p>
        <p>Best regards,</p>

        <p>
          We have 84 people traveling to Michigan this weekend which is the
          largest group this club has ever brought to Nationals before! This
          makes me extremely proud, and I cannot wait for you all to stunt on
          all these other schools by having the most fun while also competing
          the best! To everyone competing, you are going to have the full
          support of one of the largest teams in the country behind you while
          you compete!
        </p>
        <p>
          We are all here to support each other, so don&#39;t be nervous but
          rather be confident in yourself and all the work you have put in! No
          matter the outcome, as long as you try your very best I will always be
          proud of you :)

          the letters on a keyboard are called uppercase and lowercase because
          the capital letters were placed on the higher shelf, or upper case, of
          the printing press stand, and the smaller letters were placed on the
          bottom shelf, or lower case. Etymology is fun sometimes.

          Thanks again for reading to the very bottom. I wonder how many people
          actually make it this far. Well, for this week of Wyatt&#39;s Fun Fact
          of the Week, we have animal group names. Did you know:
        </p>
        <li>A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance,</li>
        <li>A group of crows is called a murder,</li>
        <li>A group of toads is called a knot, and</li>
        <li>A group of porcupines is called a prickle.</li>
        <p>
          I hope you enjoyed these fun facts. As someone studying science, I
          think it&#39;s important to not lose sight of the fun in life and have
          silly names. I hope you have a wonderful week and let me know if you
          know of any other good animal group names.

          <strong>
            {" "}
            Please bring your old shoes and spikes to practice to donate!
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In conjunction with this, we will also be doing a spike night at
          RunAbout sports on <strong>Tuesday, March 14th, from 5-7 pm. </strong>
          We will have the store to ourselves for two hours, and we will receive
          15% of the proceeds made during that night. This way you can donate
          your old running shoes and buy a new pair, which also benefits the
          club! It&#39;ll be a lot of fun and RunAbout sports is a great company
          that is a staple of the Blacksburg running community.

        <p>
          How have we been doing? Now that we&#39;re almost halfway done through
          the semester (that&#39;s wild to think about), we‚Äôd like to hear from
          you about what we&#39;ve been doing well and what we can improve upon!

          and let us know your thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more people that fill it out, the more input we have, and the
          easier it is for us to become the best officer board we can be!

        <h3>Giving Day Rewards</h3>
        <p>
          Because our club is full of so many amazing people, you all reached
          all three of our donation incentives! The most anticipated one, of
          course, is throwing a pie at an officer! That will take place{" "}
          <strong>this Tuesday at practice. </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We will be randomly selecting 13 individuals to throw a plate of
          whipped cream at each one of the officers at practice. If practice is
          canceled over weather, we will postpone this until a better day.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          We will also be bringing ice cream to practice after Spring Break. If
          you won a prize in our raffle, Suzie will be handing those out at
          practice as well.{" "}
        </p>
        <h3>Spike Night &amp; Shoe Drive</h3>
        <p>
          Normally I would announce this next week, but because of Spring Break,
          I am going to let you all know of this exciting opportunity now!
          Starting the week of <strong>March 13th</strong>, we will be
          conducting a used shoe drive where you can hand us your used pairs of
          shoes and spikes! The used shoes will be donated to the MORE
          Foundation Group (learn more{" "}
          <a

          ) to help those in need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any spikes you donate will be given to athletes at Blacksburg Middle
          and High School, so your donations are directly benefiting the running
          community in Blacksburg, which I think is great.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conjunction with this, we will also be doing a spike night at
          RunAbout sports on <strong>Tuesday, March 14th, from 5-7 pm.</strong>{" "}
          We will have the store to ourselves for two hours, and we will receive
          15% of the proceeds made. This is a great way for you to support the
          club and the Blacksburg running community while also grabbing a sweet
          pair of shoes.

          <strong>we will not be having practice on Friday, March 3rd</strong>.
          Be sure to look out for unofficial practices, though, as plenty of
          people will be organizing activities. I hope you have a fun and safe
          Spring Break!

        <p>
          Thank you for reading to the very end. I&#39;m thinking of including a
          fun fact at the bottom of each so you can become just a little more
          enlightened each week by a useless fun fact. This week is going to be
          about otters. Did you know that otters have a favorite rock that they
          will carry with them to crack open clams? I think that is lovely.

          Bit of a chiller week with fun stuff planned, but we are also 2 weeks
          away from Spring break! I know you all have been working super hard
          being student athletes, so you all have earned a well deserved break

          administrative things about being a club member. Every club member
          must agree to the{" "}
          <a
            href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1spaF6IMfr2eUkN4Yq1VaN6rUx5yBX_RO/view?usp=sharing"

          >
            Sport Club Code of Conduct
          </a>{" "}
          (this was on your IMLeague forms).Please be sure to read it again and
          understand it, as those are the rules that our club must follow and
          that we enforce. We want to remind everyone that alcohol is not
          permitted at any official club events, and that no one should be
          wearing any club apparel if they plan on drinking alcohol in a public
          environment. Each and every one of you who are official members are
          representatives of the club and by extension, Virginia Tech. Please be
          sure to make wise decisions and always represent the club well as you
          already do!
        </p>
        <h3>Spring Meet Schedule and New Racer Info</h3>
        <p>
          The meet schedules can be found on our competition pages. As you can
          see there are a couple of locations that are tbd. The first is NIRCA
          Nationals ‚Äî we are still waiting for NIRCA to announce this year‚Äôs
          nationals location but as soon as I hear about it I will let you all
          know! Secondly, on April 15th we will be going to a meet, but we are
          still finalizing which meet that will be. We just wanted to give you
          all the date so that you can mark your calendars!
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, with a lot of the meets being later in the semester, we
          wanted to offer an additional opportunity for those of you who would
          like to race. On February 11th, the Penn State XCTF Club is hosting an
          indoor meet. **THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL MEET** That means you are free to
          go and compete as a club athlete (you can wear your uniform), but we
          will not be traveling as a team for this. Therefore{" "}
          <b>ALL travel/lodging accommodations are up to you!</b> However, we
          will cover the entry fee. If you are interested, please fill{" "}

        <p>Hey, at least I don't have class tomorrow...</p>
        <p>
          Good morning fellow club members and website enjoyers. It is currently
          3:46 AM and I've been staring at this website for the past 14 hours.
          But it's ok, because as I'm writing this, the website is live on the
          proper domain and we are no longer "powered by Weebly!" :D
        </p>
        <p>
          So what's new? Well, everything. Basically, if it was on the old site,
          its here and even better. Want uniform training plans? We got it.
          Maybe you want to see the routes we run on every day? It's here. Maybe
          you wanted the webmaster's thoughts beamed straight to your eyeballs.
          Guess what? You're looking at it.
        </p>
        <p>
          That being said, I'm always open to suggestions so if you don't think
          something working the way it should or you would like to see something
          added to the website, I'm your guy. Just let me know at practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm also assuming my self-appointed position as club reporter. I'll be
          posting articles here about announcements, meets, etc. so make sure to
          check this page on the regular.
        </p>
        <p>
          PS: I know I said everything is here but if you're wondering where the
          records page went, don't worry I'm working on a new system to keep
          track of records. The new records page will be up soon.

        <p>
          If someone tries to tell you that the hardest part about making a
          website is the code, they have no idea what they're talking about.
          Pictures are the bane of my existence and if I have to look at another
          .svg file, you might never see me again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let me walk you through a part of what I've been doing these past two
          days.
        </p>
        <h3>Part 1:</h3>
        <p>
          So as it turns out the web host I'm using for this gives the website
          100GB/month of free bandwith. This includes data for images that have
          to be loaded (at least for the first time) on every single device that
          looks at this magnificient piece of art we like to call the club
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might say "What's the problem, Volkan? That seems plenty," and it
          would be if not for the fact that the photos are BIG. And this is
          after I've made them considerably smaller compared to the gargantuan
          resolutions the camera takes them at. So I decided it's better to nip
          this in the bud while there's only around 20 pictures on the website
          and got to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hope you brought some snacks because we're just getting started. I
          wanted to use Imgur to host the images so the web host won't throw a
          fit over sending people some pictures. Of course it can't be as easy
          as "just put the pictures on Imgur." There happens to be a Google
          Photos album I have with around 500 of the best photos I hand-picked
          over the course of the past semester from the semester album and they
          had to all be processed and uploaded to Imgur so I didn't have to go
          through this every time I try to use a photo for the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily, Photoshop came to the rescue. It has this neat feature where
          you can just run a script to automatically go through a folder, resize
          all images, and spit them out in a different folder. So I ran this for
          about 15 minutes and then uploaded the entire thing to a private Imgur
          album.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I had to go through all of the website files, delete every
          image, and when it inevitably gave an error about not being able to
          find the pictures, I went in and replaced the source with the Imgur
          link. This was much easier than going through the actual code and
          trying to figure out where every single reference to an image is. Now
          no one (me) has to worry about where the pictures are stored in the
          files and more importantly, bandwith shouldn't be an issue.
        </p>
        <h3>Part 2:</h3>
        <p>
          Never did I think when I made the logo over the summer that it would
          cause me this much frustration half a year down the line. So it all
          started when I was making the footer and I needed icons for the social
          media links. I went on a websitie and found some I liked and set them
          as the backgrounds for the links. Now, I wanted the icons to change
          color when hovered over but as it turns out, this is very hard to do
          when you set an SVG file as the background.
        </p>
        <p>
          *Technical sidenote: Some people a while ago figured out you can save
          simple images like logos as text that contains instructions on how to
          draw it instead of an actual image, this way it can be scaled up or
          down as much as you want and thus, the Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG)
          format was born. The predecessor to this actually dates back to the
          60s and was first used in graphic design. I was forced to read through
          this during my several hour long journey to fix this issue so now you
          know too!
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, some genius online made{" "}
          <a
            href="https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp"
            target={"_blank"}
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            a tool
          </a>{" "}
          to generate a filter you can place over your SVG icon that, given the
          icon starts off completely black, will turn it into any other color
          you want. You can check out the link if you want to see how
          complicated a simple color change can be using this method, it's
          really cool stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          After fixing this I had the bright idea to make the club logo into an
          SVG as well. Now I wouldn't have to use the Imgur link every time I
          wanted to display the logo, but mostly because it seemed like an
          interesting thing to do. Boy, was I wrong. I ended up spending way too
          much time trying to get it to center and size properly in the footer
          since it behaves so much differently to a normal image and I'm just
          not as familiar with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, I got it to look right by hardcoding the specific heights
          and widths associated with it so that it never looks off. It might not
          be the optimal solution but if it works, it works. So kids, the lesson
          to take away is to stay away from SVGs and you might just stay sane a
          little longer.

          page you're on now. Despite how long it took, working on this page
          actually gave me a lot of confidence for how the rest of this process
          will go.

          Believe it or not, I had originally planned for the site to go live
          around the beginning of the Fall but it kept getting bigger and bigger
          and with school and running on top of it, I had to push it back.
          Hopefully you're as impressed with the final result as I hope to be!

          Anyways, have you checked out ChatGPT yet? This part of the blog will
          probably be a bit outdated by the time you see this but it's
          incredible what it can do. I'm mostly impressed by how well it can
          write and understand code. I actually asked it for help one of the
          times I was stuck making this page and it showed me how to do exactly
          what I was trying to and even gave examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll leave a link to it{" "}
          <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target={"_blank"} rel="noreferrer">
            here
          </a>{" "}
          so you can see for yourself and this is also my first time testing
          external links from articles so hopefully that worked.

          There's a lot of work to do tomorrow so I should probably get some
          sleep so thank you for tuning in to the first ever (weekly?) edition
          of Webdev Diaries by yours truly, Volkan, and if you're reading this
          in the future, which you will be, let me know at practice what you
          think!

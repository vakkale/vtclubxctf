  <h3>
    🐼 Panda Express Percentage Night (10/28)
  </h3>
  <p>
    We will be heading over to Panda Express on Prices Fork after practice on
      Monday, October 28 for a fundraiser percentage night! 20% of the proceeds
      go to the club, so make sure to show the attached flyer or simply tell the
      cashier that you’re with the team. If you can’t make it after practice,
      the deal is in place from 10:30am to 9:30pm, so you can go at any point in
      the day!
  </p>
  <h3>
    🕟 Practice Time Moving to 4:30 (11/4)
  </h3>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, fall brings shorter days and the end of Daylight Savings
      Time, meaning practice will move to 4:30 pm starting Monday, November 4 to
      prevent us from running in the dark.
  </p>
  <h3>
    👔 Semester Shirts Are Here!&nbsp;
  </h3>
  <p>
    If you paid your dues by September 13 and filled out the membership
      survey, we have a shirt for you! You can pick it up at practice and wear
      it every day for the rest of eternity to show all your friends how much
      you love club. Apparel has been ordered, but has not arrived yet. We will
      let you know when it is in!&nbsp;
  </p>
  <h3>🗓️ Social Calendar&nbsp;</h3>
  <p>
    Check the highlight on our Instagram to see our calendar for the rest of
      the semester. Mark these dates so you don’t miss them!
  </p>
  <h3>
    👻 Halloween Costume Contest (10/31)
  </h3>
  <p>
    We'll be hosting a Halloween costume contest at practice on Thursday,
      October 31! The winners will get some extra VT Club XCTF merch we have
      laying around.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <h3>
    🎥 Movie Night/Poster Making Social (11/3)
  </h3>
  <p>
    With XC Nationals right around the corner, we want everyone to have all
      the support they can get during their race! What better way to support
      your fellow teammates than to cheer them on with posters made with love?
      Poster making is optional but having fun is not, so we will also have a
      movie for everyone on the projector. Keep an eye out for a GroupMe poll to
      pick the movie! We will meet in Durham 261 at 6pm on Sunday, November
      3.

  <h3>🏋 Lift Is Back!&nbsp;</h3>
  <p>
    Somehow, we’ve always had events on Thursdays, but we’re so back this
      week! After the costume contest and practice, head over to the Bubble to
      pump some iron with your fellow cross country and track &amp; field
      stars.
  </p>
  <p>Have a great week!</p>

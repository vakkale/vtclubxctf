    üêæ Bear Tracks (10/10 &amp; 10/11)
  </h3>
  <p>
    It's the last week of Bear Tracks! From 8:45 to 9:15am on Thursday and
      Friday, you can come to the elementary school and run around with
      kindergartners through 5th graders. This week‚Äôs theme is ‚ÄúBubble Track‚Äù -
      we will be blowing bubbles as the kids run through them. This is your last
      chance to do Bear Tracks this semester, don't miss it!&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>
    ü•Ñ Assassin Starts Today&nbsp;
  </h3>
  <p>
    Come to practice to get your spoons and let the games begin!
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>
    üéΩ Singlet Requirement for Racing&nbsp;
  </h3>
  <p>
    To compete in NIRCA meets (which all our meets are), you are required to
      wear a VT singlet. We have specially licensed singlets that we purchase
      every year and sell for $40 (we make no profit from this!)&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    You can purchase a singlet during practice from our apparel officer
      Molly. We only accept cash or check (made out to ‚ÄúTreasurer at Virginia
      Tech‚Äù). You only have to purchase a singlet once and you can reuse it
      every other year you compete with club.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are only planning on racing in the Spring, you can wait till then
      to purchase one.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h3>üì∏ Photo Album&nbsp;</h3>
  <p>
    You can find the photos from last weekend‚Äôs race and any other club event
      here:<a
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
      href="https://virginiatech.sharepoint.com/sites/VTClubXCTF/Photos/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FVTClubXCTF%2FPhotos%2FPhotos&amp;p=true&amp;ga=1&amp;LOF=1"
      >Photos</a
    >. This album will have all the photos from this year, so be sure to check
      it out after each event!&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    For the best way to view photos:&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    1. Click on the link to get access.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Download the OneDrive app or go to OneDrive on your
      computer.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Find the VT Club XCTF Photo album.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>
    4. On the top right, you can select to view the photos as tiles, instead
      of a list. This will give you the best experience looking through photos.
      I‚Äôve also noticed that the app tends to load significantly quicker than
      the website.&nbsp;

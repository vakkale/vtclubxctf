      >As you all likely know by now, for the first time in club history, we
      have claimed the XC nationals title! In a nail-biting race, your men’s
      championship team edged out Cal Poly by a single point to win the race and
      bring home our first XC Nats trophy (and a giant Hershey’s bar)! The
      women’s championship team finished 5th after a very competitive race and
      cemented the fact that we are undoubtedly the most well-rounded team in
      the nation.&nbsp;</span

  <p>
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"
      >In the last 3 years of national competition (track and XC, men and
      women), we’ve come in 1st place 3 times, 2nd place 2 times, 3rd place 5
      times and 5th place 2 times. And 0 times below 5th place in that time
      span. No one else does it like we do, and the culture of consistency,
      well-roundedness, and depth we have is something to appreciate.</span

      >As we wrap up the season, take pride in what we’ve accomplished together
      and the legacy we’re building for the future. This title belongs to every
      one of you, and it’s a reflection of the hard work and heart you bring to
      this team.</span

      >An important note from President Volkan..</span
    >
  </h3>
  <p>
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"
      >I wanted to go over something important that happened recently. Over the
      course of the semester, we’ve unknowingly let some people race without
      having IMLeagues completed. This is a mistake on my part and I should’ve
      been more thorough with checking the eligibility requirement before
      races.&nbsp;</span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"
      >The Sport Clubs office asked us last week what we thought would be a fair
      sanction to pose on the club and we, rightfully, took the blame for not
      being on top of our members completing their forms. This means that
      myself, Jamie, and Ellie are suspended for 4 meets, including last
      weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"
      >The office, however, also wanted those that raced without completing
      IMLeagues to be suspended from racing at nationals. After some back and
      forth, we were able to let those ineligible on Saturday to race in
      exchange for sitting out one more meet ourselves. While this is, in my
      opinion, the best outcome we could’ve had given the circumstances, we
      never should’ve been in this position to begin with.&nbsp;</span
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"
      >Lastly, I am working with the board as a whole and with Joe, who will be
      in charge next year, to develop an easy way to check all eligibility
      requirements in one place and make it easier to stay on top of things. I
      hope this serves as a cautionary tale emphasizing the importance of doing
      your IMLeagues forms on time, as your own eligibility could be on the
      line.&nbsp;</span

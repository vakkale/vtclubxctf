      go to the club, so make sure to show the attached flyer or simply tell the
      cashier that you’re with the team. If you can’t make it after practice,
      the deal is in place from 10:30am to 9:30pm, so you can go at any point in

      pick the movie! We will meet in Durham 261 at 6pm on Sunday, November
